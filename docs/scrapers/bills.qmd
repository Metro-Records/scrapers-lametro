- Located in `lametro/bills.py`
- Creates board reports and their associated attachments, sponsorships, votes, 
relations, and topics

## Key issues

- Board reports are added to the Legistar API before they are published to InSite. We
need to determine which are "private" in order to suppress them in Councilmatic.
  - [Why do we need to scrape private bills?](https://github.com/Metro-Records/la-metro-councilmatic/pull/394#issuecomment-461922234)
  - [Limit private scrape](https://github.com/opencivicdata/scrapers-us-municipal/pull/262)
- Our windowed scrapes rely on timestamps from the Legistar API, however the timestamps
are not always updated when changes are made.
  - [Metro scraper did not scrape EventAgendaStatusName](https://github.com/opencivicdata/scrapers-us-municipal/issues/239)
  - [Metro: Scrape matters updated within a window, as well as matters related to events updated within a window](https://github.com/opencivicdata/scrapers-us-municipal/pull/344)
