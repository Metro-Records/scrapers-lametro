title: "Jurisdiction Scraper"
order: 1
---

- Located in `lametro/__init__.py`
- Creates jurisdiction, organization, and posts
  - Specifically, creates organizations that are not coded as the board itself or a committee
  in the Legistar API, as bodies meeting these parameters are created in the people scraper
- Creates legislative sessions

## Key issues

- [Summary of divisions and posts](https://github.com/Metro-Records/la-metro-councilmatic/issues/1025#issuecomment-1761681420)
- Legislative sessions must be added manually every June. The scraper breaks if they are not
added before legislation is created in the new session.
