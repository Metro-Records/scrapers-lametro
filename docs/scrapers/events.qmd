- Located in `lametro/events.py`
- Creates events

::: {.callout-tip}
The following terms all refer to the same thing:

- Event (Legistar API, Open Civic Data universe, Councilmatic models)
- Meeting (Legistar UI, Councilmatic UI)
:::

## Key issues

- Metro streams audio in both English and Spanish. They cannot associate multiple
broadcast link with one event in Legistar, so they create two nearly identical events that
we merge during scrapes.
  - [Import and display the Spanish language audio](https://github.com/Metro-Records/la-metro-councilmatic/issues/263)
  - ["Ver en espa√±ol" link not visible](https://github.com/Metro-Records/la-metro-councilmatic/issues/393)
- The board approves minutes for their previous meeting each time they meet. Sometimes,
these minutes are explicitly associated with the event. When they aren't, we try to guess
the approved minutes file.
  - [Find approved minutes](https://github.com/opencivicdata/scrapers-us-municipal/pull/291)
  - [Upgrades to the LA Metro scraper](https://github.com/opencivicdata/scrapers-us-municipal/pull/299)
  - [Event scrape: If there is more than one minutes file, which one should we use?](https://github.com/Metro-Records/la-metro-councilmatic/issues/742)
  - [Account for multiple meeting minutes](https://github.com/Metro-Records/scrapers-lametro/issues/16)
